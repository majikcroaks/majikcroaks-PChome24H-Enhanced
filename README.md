# PChome24H Enhanced
### A Chrome extension that adds a price filter for the listing in store page.
#### Works when matching http\*://24h.pchome.com.tw/store/\*

When browsing the PChome24H stores, only product search page provides a price filter function, so I decided to add the funtction to the store view as well.

### Features
1. Force list view when viewing store page.
2. Price filter from the lower and the upper bound.

### Todo
1. Extend item counts per page (36 items per page by default).
2. Add options for the extension.
3. Other features.
